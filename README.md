**Esecutive Summary:**

Our main objective to perform exploratory data analysis on application and credit records using historical credit data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms (refer to technical requirements), 
the system aims to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and mitigate risks associated with lending. To perform exploratory data analysis on application and credit records

**Key Deliverables:**

Cleaned datasets for analysis
Analysis the key insights and trends based the headings
Machine learning models for credit risk
Deployed the credit risk assessment using Juypter lab

**Data Analysis on Application Data & Credit record:**

Analyzed unique IDs in the application record.
Visualized categorical data distribution using bar plots.
Explored income types and their total income.
Analyzed unique IDs in the credit record.
Visualized credit statuses using a bar plot.
Performed data aggregation to prepare for modeling

**We used 5 different machine Learning models:**
1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Linear Regression
5. Decision Tree Classifier

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the models showcased varying levels of accuracy and performance. Decision trees and SVM exhibited the highest accuracies, while logistic regression performed relatively lower. 
It's essential to consider not only the overall accuracy but also delve into the confusion matrices to understand the model's behavior across different classes. 
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand and the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive performance.
